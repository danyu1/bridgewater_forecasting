# QUICK REFERENCE: X Algorithm / Grok Question

## The Question
**Will the X algorithm be run by Grok before March 12, 2026?**

## Your Forecast
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Probability** | **12% YES** |
| **Community** | 5% |
| **Confidence** | Medium |
| **90% CI** | 4% - 25% |

---

## Key Dates

| Date | Event | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Jan 17, 2026** | Promised open-source release | ⚠️ CRITICAL - Check code! |
| Feb 28, 2026 | Question closes | Last forecast update |
| Mar 12, 2026 | Resolution | |

---

## Resolution Requirements (STRICT!)

For YES, need ALL of:
1. ✅ Official announcement (Musk, X, or xAI)
2. ✅ Says "EXCLUSIVELY" Grok (no other ML models)
3. ✅ "ENTIRE" personalized feed
4. ✅ NOT contradicted by credible sources within 3 days
5. ✅ Phased rollout OK, but NOT beta/pilot

## UPDATE TRIGGERS

### Increase Forecast ⬆️
| Event | New Forecast |
|-------|--------------|
| Musk announces "Grok exclusively runs X" | → **85%** |
| xAI blog announces completion | → **75%** |
| Jan 17 code shows Grok-only | → **45%** |
| Credible reporter confirms | → **50%** |

### Decrease Forecast ⬇️
| Event | New Forecast |
|-------|--------------|
| Jan 17 code shows hybrid (Grok + other) | → **5%** |
| Musk says "still working on it" | → **6%** |
| Tech analysis: other ML models active | → **3%** |
| By Feb 15, no signals | → **4%** |

## Why 12% (Not Higher, Not Lower)

**Not higher because:**
- Musk is 8+ weeks past his "4-6 week" deadline
- "EXCLUSIVELY" is a very strict bar
- Tech reporters would fact-check any claim
- Community of 63 forecasters at only 5%

**Not lower because:**
- Announcements are unpredictable events
- Musk could tweet "done" at any moment
- Work is actively ongoing (Jan 10 announcement)
- 60 days still remain

## Daily Monitoring

```bash
python monitor.py          # Full daily check
python monitor.py status   # Quick status
```

**What to check manually:**
1. @elonmusk on X
2. @xai on X  
3. xAI blog
4. TechCrunch / Verge for algorithm news

## The Key Insight

**The bottleneck is "EXCLUSIVELY"**

Grok IS being integrated. The question is:
- Will Musk ANNOUNCE it's the ONLY model?
- Will that claim survive 3 days without contradiction?

Given tech reporters would scrutinize hard, this is unlikely but not impossible.
