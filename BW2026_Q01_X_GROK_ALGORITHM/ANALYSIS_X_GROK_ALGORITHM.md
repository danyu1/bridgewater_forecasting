# STEP 1: INTAKE ✓

## Question Details
- **Question:** Will the X algorithm be run by Grok before March 12, 2026?
- **Closes:** February 28, 2026
- **Resolution:** Before March 12, 2026
- **Source:** Bridgewater x Metaculus Tournament 2026
- **Forecasters:** 63
- **Community Forecast:** 5%
- **Your Current Forecast:** 12%

## Resolution Criteria (EXACT)

**YES if:**
- X, xAI, or Elon Musk **announce** that the ENTIRE personalized feed is determined **EXCLUSIVELY** by Grok
- No other learned model or heuristic using user behavior/inferred interests (besides Grok)
- Hard filters allowed (spam, legal, safety, geo, language, user settings, timestamps)
- Phased rollout to general users = YES
- Beta/pilot limited to small users = NO
- Must be official channel (X, xAI, or on-record from Musk/executive)
- Credible sources must NOT contradict within 3 days

**This is a HIGH BAR:**
- "EXCLUSIVELY by Grok" = no other ML models
- "ENTIRE personalized selection and ordering"
- Announcement must not be contradicted

# STEP 2: KEY TIMELINE & FACTS

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Oct 17, 2025 | Musk announces "4-6 weeks" to delete all heuristics, Grok will run algorithm |
| Expected completion | ~Nov 14-28, 2025 (per Musk's timeline) |
| Jan 10, 2026 | Musk announces open-sourcing algorithm in "7 days" (Jan 17) |
| Jan 12, 2026 | TODAY - No announcement of completion |
| Feb 28, 2026 | Question closes |
| Mar 12, 2026 | Resolution deadline |

**Current Status:**
- Grok is being INTEGRATED but NOT exclusive
- Per Archyde: "only data-pipeline utilities and sandbox simulation available; core ranking algorithm remains closed"
- No announcement that transition is COMPLETE
- Musk is ~8+ weeks past his stated "4-6 weeks" timeline

# STEP 3: BASE RATE ANALYSIS

## Reference Class 1: Musk Timeline Accuracy

| Project | Promised | Actual | Ratio |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| Tesla Roadster (original) | 2008 | 2008 | 1.0x |
| Model X | 2013 | 2015 | 1.5x |
| Full Self-Driving | 2017 | Still not complete | >4x |
| Cybertruck | 2021 | 2023 | 1.5x |
| Starship orbital | 2022 | 2023 | 1.5x |
| Tesla Semi | 2019 | 2022 | 1.5x |
| SpaceX Mars timeline | Various | Consistently late | 2-4x |

**Pattern:** Musk timelines typically take 1.5-4x longer than stated.

**For this question:**
- Musk said "4-6 weeks" on Oct 17, 2025
- 4x multiplier = 16-24 weeks = Feb-Apr 2026
- 2x multiplier = 8-12 weeks = Dec 2025-Jan 2026 ← We're past this

**Base rate for "Musk meets tech timeline":** ~20-30%

## Reference Class 2: Software Migration Announcements

Large platform algorithm overhauls:
- Often announced optimistically
- Typically delayed or rolled out gradually
- "Complete" announcements often followed by corrections

**Base rate for clean announcement:** ~25-35%

# STEP 4: EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

## Factors AGAINST (pushing toward NO)

| Factor | Strength | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Already 8+ weeks past "4-6 week" deadline | Strong | -15% |
| Jan 10 announcement was about open-sourcing, NOT completion | Strong | -10% |
| "EXCLUSIVELY Grok" is very strict requirement | Moderate | -8% |
| Metaculus drivers: "Musk makes hyperbolic statements" | Moderate | -5% |
| Metaculus drivers: "Grok unlikely to integrate fully quickly" | Moderate | -5% |
| Technical complexity of 100M+ posts/day | Moderate | -5% |
| Community at 5% (experienced forecasters) | Moderate | -3% |
| No completion announcement despite deadline passed | Strong | -10% |

## Factors FOR (pushing toward YES)

| Factor | Strength | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Musk actively working on this (Jan 10 announcement) | Moderate | +5% |
| xAI raised $20B - resources available | Weak | +2% |
| Grok integration already happening | Moderate | +5% |
| 60 days remaining | Moderate | +3% |
| Musk could announce at any time (unpredictable) | Moderate | +5% |
| Phased rollout counts (not just full completion) | Weak | +3% |

## Net Evidence Assessment

Starting from ~25% base rate:
- DOWN factors: -51% (but capped - can't go below reasonable floor)
- UP factors: +23%
- Net: Strong downward pressure

# STEP 5: STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

## Decomposition Attempt

```
P(YES) = P(Musk announces "exclusively Grok") × P(not contradicted in 3 days)

P(Musk announces) = P(completion happens) × P(he announces if complete)
                  + P(completion doesn't happen) × P(he announces anyway)
                  
≈ (0.15 × 0.90) + (0.85 × 0.02)
≈ 0.135 + 0.017
≈ 0.15

P(not contradicted | announcement) ≈ 0.70
(if he announces, 30% chance credible sources contradict)

P(YES) ≈ 0.15 × 0.70 ≈ 0.105 ≈ 10-11%
```

# STEP 6: MARKET CHECK

| Source | Probability | Weight |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Metaculus Community | 5% | High (63 forecasters) |
| Your current forecast | 12% | Medium |
| My analysis | 10% | Medium |

**Community is at 5%** - this is notable. Experienced forecasters are very pessimistic.

**Why might community be too LOW?**
- Announcements are unpredictable events
- Musk could tweet this complete at any time
- Market might be anchoring too hard on missed deadline

**Why might community be RIGHT?**
- The "EXCLUSIVELY" requirement is very strict
- Technical reality likely won't match announcement
- Credible sources (tech reporters) would likely contradict

---

# STEP 7: FINAL ENSEMBLE

| Model | Estimate | Weight |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Base Rate (Musk timelines) | 20% | 0.25 |
| Evidence-Adjusted | 12% | 0.30 |
| Structural Decomposition | 10% | 0.20 |
| Community Forecast | 5% | 0.25 |

**Weighted Calculation:**
```
(0.25 × 0.20) + (0.30 × 0.12) + (0.20 × 0.10) + (0.25 × 0.05)
= 0.050 + 0.036 + 0.020 + 0.0125
= 0.1185
≈ 12%
```

---

# STEP 8: FINAL FORECAST

# **12% YES**

**90% Confidence Interval: [4%, 25%]**

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM (clear resolution criteria, but announcement unpredictability)

---

# STEP 9: COMPARISON TO COMMUNITY

| | Community | My Forecast | Difference |
|-|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 5% | 12% | +7% |

**Why I'm higher than community:**
1. Announcements are binary events - Musk COULD tweet "it's done" at any moment
2. "Phased rollout" language gives some flexibility
3. Community may be over-weighting the missed Oct deadline

**Why I'm not MUCH higher:**
1. "EXCLUSIVELY Grok" is an extremely strict bar
2. Tech reporters would likely scrutinize and contradict
3. 8+ weeks past deadline with no completion signal
4. The Jan 10 announcement was about open-sourcing, NOT completion

**Risk:** I could be wrong if community knows something I don't (e.g., technical insiders)

# STEP 10: UPDATE TRIGGERS

## Increase Forecast ⬆️

| Event | New Forecast |
|-------|--------------|
| Musk tweets "Grok now runs X algorithm exclusively" | 85% (wait for contradiction window) |
| xAI blog post about "completing" algorithm transition | 75% |
| Jan 17 open-source reveals Grok-only code | 45% |
| Credible tech reporter says "Grok running X fully" | 50% |
| By Feb 15, strong signals of imminent announcement | 25% |

## Decrease Forecast ⬇️

| Event | New Forecast |
|-------|--------------|
| Jan 17 open-source shows hybrid system (Grok + other models) | 5% |
| Musk tweets about "still working on" Grok transition | 6% |
| By Feb 15, no signals of progress | 4% |
| Technical analysis shows other ML models still active | 3% |

---

# KEY INSIGHT

**The bottleneck is the "EXCLUSIVELY" requirement.**

Grok is already being integrated into X's algorithm. The question is whether Musk will announce (and maintain for 3 days without contradiction) that Grok is the ONLY learned model making recommendations.

Given:
- Technical reality likely involves hybrid systems
- Tech reporters would scrutinize any such claim
- Musk's announcements often get fact-checked

This makes 12% reasonable - not impossible, but unlikely.

# MONITORING PLAN

**Daily:** Check @elonmusk, @xai, @x for announcements
**Key date:** January 17, 2026 (promised open-source release)
**What to look for:**
- Any claim of "complete" or "exclusive" Grok algorithm
- Tech reporter analysis of X's recommendation system
- Open-source code review (will reveal if Grok-only)

---

**FINAL ANSWER: 12% YES**

*This matches your current forecast - well calibrated!*
