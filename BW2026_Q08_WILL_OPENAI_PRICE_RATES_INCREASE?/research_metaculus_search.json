The designation led to a slashing of US assistance to the country. [The Trump administration also imposed sanctions](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-petro-sanctions-drug-trafficking-1b6ead338ec266b3df40859db6ee2d8d) in October 2025 on President Gustavo Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade.\n\nOn January 5, 2026, US President [Donald J. Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-new-military-operation-focused-colombia-sounds-good-him-2026-01-05/) told reporters aboard Air Force One that military action against Colombia's government \"sounds good to me\":\n\n> \"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump told reporters... in an apparent reference to Colombia's President.\n\nColombia\u2019s outspoken left-wing President has responded to the US capture of [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-capture-trump-attack-military-ceb21da088f0a06b1813e66922def9a3) by escalating his [spiraling war of words with the US President](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-petro-trump-venezuela-maduro-eaf98a41ae427a2d218910606a6fa3e0), stating it was an \u201cabhorrent\u201d violation of [Latin American sovereignty](https://apnews.com/photo-gallery/trump-venezuela-cuba-colombia-mexico-imperialism-600f77e9930aaf6cd856b4a384c51287). He also suggested it was committed by \"enslavers\" and constituted a \"spectacle of death\" comparable to Nazi Germany\u2019s 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.\n\nDespite this, just days later the [US President abruptly changed](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-venezuela-petro-610cfdb86d38544712c3f673639845e1) his tone stating the two Presidents had exchanged a friendly phone call and he had invited the Colombian President to the White House.\n\n[The two countries have a historic alliance](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-petro-trump-venezuela-maduro-eaf98a41ae427a2d218910606a6fa3e0) but political tensions remain.\n\n> For Colombia, the U.S. remains key to the military\u2019s fight against leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers.

        "description": "In September 2025, the United States added Colombia to a list of nations [failing to cooperate in the drug war](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-drug-war-cooperation-14493c8f7a9af102a8a29cc368ac1e03) for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of US assistance to the country. [The Trump administration also imposed sanctions](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-petro-sanctions-drug-trafficking-1b6ead338ec266b3df40859db6ee2d8d) in October 2025 on President Gustavo Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade.\n\nOn January 5, 2026, US President [Donald J. Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-new-military-operation-focused-colombia-sounds-good-him-2026-01-05/) told reporters aboard Air Force One that military action against Colombia's government \"sounds good to me\":\n\n> \"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump told reporters... in an apparent reference to Colombia's President.\n\nColombia\u2019s outspoken left-wing President has responded to the US capture of [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-capture-trump-attack-military-ceb21da088f0a06b1813e66922def9a3) by escalating his [spiraling war of words with the US President](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-petro-trump-venezuela-maduro-eaf98a41ae427a2d218910606a6fa3e0), stating it was an \u201cabhorrent\u201d violation of [Latin American sovereignty](https://apnews.com/photo-gallery/trump-venezuela-cuba-colombia-mexico-imperialism-600f77e9930aaf6cd856b4a384c51287). He also suggested it was committed by \"enslavers\" and constituted a \"spectacle of death\" comparable to Nazi Germany\u2019s 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.\n\nDespite this, just days later the [US President abruptly changed](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-venezuela-petro-610cfdb86d38544712c3f673639845e1) his tone stating the two Presidents had exchanged a friendly phone call and he had invited the Colombian President to the White House.\n\n[The two countries have a historic alliance](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-petro-trump-venezuela-maduro-eaf98a41ae427a2d218910606a6fa3e0) but political tensions remain.\n\n> For Colombia, the U.S. remains key to the military\u2019s fight against leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers. Washington has provided Bogot\u00e1 with roughly \\$14 billion in the last two decades.\n\n> For the U.S., Colombia remains the cornerstone of its counternarcotics strategy abroad, providing crucial intelligence used [to interdict drugs in the Caribbean](https://apnews.com/article/only-on-ap-smuggling-30c3e97599eb4b859ca575c58baab4ef)."

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting.

As in past Games, countries such as Norway, Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, and others may field multiple medal contenders in the same events, creating the possibility of podium sweeps.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41370,\"question_id\":41081}}`",

He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.\n\n> \"We have to fix the country first.

In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.\"\n\n> Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.\n\n> \"We have to fix the country first. You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,\" Trump told NBC.\n\nSee also from Wikipedia: [Next Venezuelan Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Venezuelan_presidential_election)"

This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\"",

          "fine_print": "* To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Venezuelan territory or military forces: cyberattacks or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.\n* For the purpose of this question, Venezuela's territory refers to its land and internal waters. External waters such as territorial waters will not count.\n* The peaceful presence of U.S. troops or personnel in Venezuela with the assent of Venezuela's government will not cause this question to resolve as **Yes**.\n* The U.S. need not initiate a conflict in order for the question to resolve as **Yes**.",

        "description": "On January 3, 2026, the United States launched a [surprise attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_States_strikes_in_Venezuela) on Venezuela, bombing military bases and infrastructure and capturing and removing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife from the country. This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\""

[<u>Presidential autopens have been used across multiple administrations to sign executive orders</u>](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/nx-s1-5330709/autopen-biden-pardon-void), proclamations, and other official acts, and longstanding legal guidance indicates that a president does not need to physically sign a document themselves for it to be valid so long as the signature reflects the president\u2019s authorization.\n\nIn late 2025, former President Donald Trump publicly declared via social media that all executive orders, pardons, and other actions signed using an autopen under Joe Biden\u2019s administration were [<u>\u201cnull and void\u201d and \u201cof no further force or effect.\u201d</u>](https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/34128?) The claim was echoed by Republican lawmakers and a [<u>House Oversight Committee report</u>](https://news.ssbcrack.com/house-oversight-committee-urges-doj-investigation-into-bidens-autopen-usage-questions-legitimacy-of-executive-actions/) asserting that Biden\u2019s alleged cognitive decline and use of the autopen could undermine the legitimacy of his actions.\n\nLegal experts and nonpartisan fact-checkers have countered these claims, noting there is [<u>no constitutional mechanism for one president to unilaterally declare another president\u2019s actions void simply because an autopen was used</u>](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-claim-that-biden-pardons-are-void-because-he-used-an-autopen).

Whether any such legal challenge will reach a court with jurisdiction to consider the constitutional validity of these actions \u2014 and whether a court would rule they are \u201cnull and void\u201d \u2014 remains unresolved.",

          "description": "Gold is highly popular among precious metals as an investment. Investors generally buy gold as a way of diversifying risk, especially through the use of futures contracts and derivatives. [Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gold-price-silver-whats-behind-the-surge/) and during periods of market volatility or economic uncertainty.\n\n[On 26 December 2025](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/should-i-invest-gold-prices-123542208.html), gold (GC=F) hit an all time high of \\$4,549.71 per ounce.&#x20;\n\n> Gold ([GC=F](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F)) prices extended gains at the start of the year after ending 2025 with a 64% rise, the strongest annual performance since 1979, as investors bet on further monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve... The metal has doubled in value from the \\$2,000 level it held two years ago. Since 2000, gold has outperformed global equities, delivering a return of more than 1,200%.\n\nMichael Hsueh, research analyst at Deutsche Bank, now thinks [gold prices could approach \\$5,000 during 2026](https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/gold-price). Whilst [a recent Financial Times survey](https://www.ft.com/content/a2b62f00-3174-4818-9a90-7489fc9be6d8) suggests gold is set to \"extend its historic rally to hit fresh highs in 2026, although analysts expect the metal\u2019s advance to slow after a year of stunning gains\".\n\nAs [Reuters reported on January 5, 2026](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-surges-us-capture-venezuela-president-spurs-safe-haven-demand-2026-01-05/), current geopolitical risks may continue to affect the price of gold during 2026.\n\n> Gold rose to a one-week high and nearer its record peak on Monday as safe-haven demand spurred by U.S. strikes in Venezuela added to bullion's appeal, already fuelled by geopolitical tensions and rate cut bets.",

Since 2000, gold has outperformed global equities, delivering a return of more than 1,200%.\n\nMichael Hsueh, research analyst at Deutsche Bank, now thinks [gold prices could approach \\$5,000 during 2026](https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/gold-price). Whilst [a recent Financial Times survey](https://www.ft.com/content/a2b62f00-3174-4818-9a90-7489fc9be6d8) suggests gold is set to \"extend its historic rally to hit fresh highs in 2026, although analysts expect the metal\u2019s advance to slow after a year of stunning gains\".\n\nAs [Reuters reported on January 5, 2026](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-surges-us-capture-venezuela-president-spurs-safe-haven-demand-2026-01-05/), current geopolitical risks may continue to affect the price of gold during 2026.\n\n> Gold rose to a one-week high and nearer its record peak on Monday as safe-haven demand spurred by U.S. strikes in Venezuela added to bullion's appeal, already fuelled by geopolitical tensions and rate cut bets."

His leadership has been closely associated with the expansion of state militarization and the consolidation of power within the office of the Supreme Leader. Khamenei has also faced many protests [during his time as Supreme Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei).&#x20;\n\nOn December 29, 2025, [Iran\u2019s largest protests in three years](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) erupted after [the country\u2019s currency plummeted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-gold-silver-jewelry-sales-israel-war-0e774bc3c2fea972ab3225e1864a438e) to a record low against the U.S. dollar, and the head of the Central Bank resigned.&#x20;\n\n[Later in the week](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d),\n\n> U.S. President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials exchanged dueling threats Friday as [widening protests](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) swept across parts of the Islamic Republic, further escalating tensions between the countries after [America bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-war-nuclear-talks-geneva-news-06-21-2025-a7b0cdaba28b5817467ccf712d214579).\n\nOn January 3, 2026, [Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader insisted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-nuclear-economy-cf491782ecafdc9098878e5a4e5dc384),\n\n> that \u201crioters must be put in their place\u201d after a week of protests that have shaken the Islamic Republic, likely giving security forces a green light to aggressively put down the demonstrations... the demonstrations sparked by Iran\u2019s ailing economy has killed at least 15 people, according to human rights activists.&#x20;\n\n> While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. They also take on new importance after Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President [Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-explosions-caracas-ca712a67aaefc30b1831f5bf0b50665e), a longtime ally of Tehran.",

        "description": "Since June 4, 1989 Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, has been [Supreme Leader of Iran](https://www.leader.ir/en), a position that has been [described by Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/country/iran) as having the ultimate power within the country.&#x20;\n\nIdentified as a pragmatic hardliner, Khamenei sidelined leftist factions, moderate clerics, and political dissidents, while occasionally easing restrictions when the government's stability or legitimacy has been threatened. His leadership has been closely associated with the expansion of state militarization and the consolidation of power within the office of the Supreme Leader. Khamenei has also faced many protests [during his time as Supreme Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei).&#x20;\n\nOn December 29, 2025, [Iran\u2019s largest protests in three years](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) erupted after [the country\u2019s currency plummeted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-gold-silver-jewelry-sales-israel-war-0e774bc3c2fea972ab3225e1864a438e) to a record low against the U.S. dollar, and the head of the Central Bank resigned.&#x20;\n\n[Later in the week](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d),\n\n> U.S. President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials exchanged dueling threats Friday as [widening protests](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) swept across parts of the Islamic Republic, further escalating tensions between the countries after [America bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-war-nuclear-talks-geneva-news-06-21-2025-a7b0cdaba28b5817467ccf712d214579).\n\nOn January 3, 2026, [Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader insisted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-nuclear-economy-cf491782ecafdc9098878e5a4e5dc384),\n\n> that \u201crioters must be put in their place\u201d after a week of protests that have shaken the Islamic Republic, likely giving security forces a green light to aggressively put down the demonstrations... the demonstrations sparked by Iran\u2019s ailing economy has killed at least 15 people, according to human rights activists.&#x20;\n\n> While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. They also take on new importance after Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President [Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-explosions-caracas-ca712a67aaefc30b1831f5bf0b50665e), a longtime ally of Tehran."

He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega. In 1983, the UNGA passed Resolution [38/7](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/38/7) condemning the US [invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Grenada) of Grenada.&#x20;"

Hammond bets that real US GDP growth will average above 5% from 2028 to 2033 on a compound annual growth basis, while Luttig bets against. Hammond [recently outlined](/) his expectations of faster growth due to AI in the next decade, a position he has [held since around the time the bet was made](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/08/manhattan-project-for-ai-safety-00095779).\n\nLuttig has written pieces from the [time of the bet](https://blog.johnluttig.com/p/hallucinations-in-ai) and [recently](https://blog.johnluttig.com/p/hypercapitalism-and-the-ai-talent) suggesting that AI is likely to continue advancing and could lead to significant changes, though has generally taken a more cautious and uncertain position around its effects and trajectory. No public statements by Luttig explicitly addressing the bet were identified."

This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\"",

          "fine_print": "* To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Venezuelan territory or military forces: cyberattacks or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.\n* For the purpose of this question, Venezuela's territory refers to its land and internal waters. External waters such as territorial waters will not count.\n* The peaceful presence of U.S. troops or personnel in Venezuela with the assent of Venezuela's government will not cause this question to resolve as **Yes**.\n* The U.S. need not initiate a conflict in order for the question to resolve as **Yes**.",

The Constitution and longstanding practice empower the president to [<u>issue pardons</u>](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46179) and [<u>take executive actions</u>](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-1/ALDE_00000243/); courts have generally held that mechanical signatures are valid if the underlying decision was the president\u2019s.\n\nAs of late 2025, [<u>Republican calls for investigations or legal reviews</u>](https://www.wbbjtv.com/2025/10/28/republicans-send-biden-autopen-report-to-the-justice-department-urging-further-investigation/) by the Department of Justice and other officials have not resulted in any judicial rulings declaring Biden\u2019s autopen-signed orders invalid. Whether any such legal challenge will reach a court with jurisdiction to consider the constitutional validity of these actions \u2014 and whether a court would rule they are \u201cnull and void\u201d \u2014 remains unresolved."

          "description": "*This forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy:* [*Will the U.S. Supreme Court overturn provisions of the Voting Rights Act as part of Louisiana v. Callais?*](https://www.verity.news/controversy/Will-the-US-Supreme-Court-overturn-provisions-in-the-Voting-Rights-Act-Louisiana-v-Callais)\n\nThe [<u>Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA)</u>](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act) is a foundational U.S. civil rights law designed to prevent racial discrimination in voting. [<u>Section 2 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act) prohibits voting practices or districting plans that result in minority voters having less opportunity than others to elect representatives of their choice, regardless of the intent behind the law or map. Unlike the VRA\u2019s preclearance regime, Section 2 applies nationwide and has remained the primary enforcement mechanism against discriminatory election maps following later court rulings.&nbsp;\n\nThe Supreme Court has narrowed portions of the VRA over the past decade. In [*<u>Shelby County v. Holder</u>*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96) (2013), the Court invalidated the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to federal preclearance, [<u>effectively suspending Section 5 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act). More recently, in [*<u>Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-1257_g204.pdf) (2021), the Court adopted a more restrictive framework for evaluating Section 2 claims related to voting rules, emphasizing state interests and historical practice.&nbsp;\n\nHowever, the Court appeared to reaffirm Section 2\u2019s application to redistricting in [*<u>Allen v. Milligan</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf) (2023), holding that Alabama\u2019s congressional map likely violated the VRA by failing to include an additional majority-Black district. The decision [<u>rejected arguments that Section 2 requires a race-neutral approach and reaffirmed longstanding precedent allowing race to be considered when remedying vote dilution.</u>](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-act-persists-so-do-its-adversaries#:~:text=But%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20stepped,protections%20for%20voters%20of%20color.)\n\n[*<u>Louisiana v. Callais</u>*](https://www.naacpldf.org/case-issue/louisiana-v-callais/) stems from [<u>post-2020 census redistricting in Louisiana</u>](https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Louisiana_after_the_2020_census). After lower federal courts found that the state\u2019s original congressional map likely violated Section 2 by containing only one majority-Black district despite the state's sizable Black population, Louisiana enacted a revised map creating a second such district. A group of voters then challenged the new map, arguing that it relied impermissibly on race and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court [<u>agreed to hear the case</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/louisiana-v-callais/), placing the continued scope of Section 2 squarely before the Court.\n\n[<u>Legal analysts note that the case could clarify or significantly alter the balance between the VRA and constitutional limits on race-based districting</u>](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-takeaways). Depending on how broadly the Court rules, the decision could [<u>either reaffirm Section 2\u2019s role in redistricting or substantially limit its future application nationwide</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/court-appears-ready-to-curtail-major-provision-of-the-voting-rights-act/).",

        "description": "*This forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy:* [*Will the U.S. Supreme Court overturn provisions of the Voting Rights Act as part of Louisiana v. Callais?*](https://www.verity.news/controversy/Will-the-US-Supreme-Court-overturn-provisions-in-the-Voting-Rights-Act-Louisiana-v-Callais)\n\nThe [<u>Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA)</u>](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act) is a foundational U.S. civil rights law designed to prevent racial discrimination in voting. [<u>Section 2 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act) prohibits voting practices or districting plans that result in minority voters having less opportunity than others to elect representatives of their choice, regardless of the intent behind the law or map. Unlike the VRA\u2019s preclearance regime, Section 2 applies nationwide and has remained the primary enforcement mechanism against discriminatory election maps following later court rulings.&nbsp;\n\nThe Supreme Court has narrowed portions of the VRA over the past decade. In [*<u>Shelby County v. Holder</u>*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96) (2013), the Court invalidated the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to federal preclearance, [<u>effectively suspending Section 5 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act). More recently, in [*<u>Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-1257_g204.pdf) (2021), the Court adopted a more restrictive framework for evaluating Section 2 claims related to voting rules, emphasizing state interests and historical practice.&nbsp;\n\nHowever, the Court appeared to reaffirm Section 2\u2019s application to redistricting in [*<u>Allen v. Milligan</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf) (2023), holding that Alabama\u2019s congressional map likely violated the VRA by failing to include an additional majority-Black district. The decision [<u>rejected arguments that Section 2 requires a race-neutral approach and reaffirmed longstanding precedent allowing race to be considered when remedying vote dilution.</u>](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-act-persists-so-do-its-adversaries#:~:text=But%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20stepped,protections%20for%20voters%20of%20color.)\n\n[*<u>Louisiana v. Callais</u>*](https://www.naacpldf.org/case-issue/louisiana-v-callais/) stems from [<u>post-2020 census redistricting in Louisiana</u>](https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Louisiana_after_the_2020_census). After lower federal courts found that the state\u2019s original congressional map likely violated Section 2 by containing only one majority-Black district despite the state's sizable Black population, Louisiana enacted a revised map creating a second such district. A group of voters then challenged the new map, arguing that it relied impermissibly on race and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court [<u>agreed to hear the case</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/louisiana-v-callais/), placing the continued scope of Section 2 squarely before the Court.\n\n[<u>Legal analysts note that the case could clarify or significantly alter the balance between the VRA and constitutional limits on race-based districting</u>](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-takeaways). Depending on how broadly the Court rules, the decision could [<u>either reaffirm Section 2\u2019s role in redistricting or substantially limit its future application nationwide</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/court-appears-ready-to-curtail-major-provision-of-the-voting-rights-act/)."

        "description": "Gold is highly popular among precious metals as an investment. Investors generally buy gold as a way of diversifying risk, especially through the use of futures contracts and derivatives. [Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gold-price-silver-whats-behind-the-surge/) and during periods of market volatility or economic uncertainty.\n\n[On 26 December 2025](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/should-i-invest-gold-prices-123542208.html), gold (GC=F) hit an all time high of \\$4,549.71 per ounce.&#x20;\n\n> Gold ([GC=F](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F)) prices extended gains at the start of the year after ending 2025 with a 64% rise, the strongest annual performance since 1979, as investors bet on further monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve... The metal has doubled in value from the \\$2,000 level it held two years ago. Since 2000, gold has outperformed global equities, delivering a return of more than 1,200%.\n\nMichael Hsueh, research analyst at Deutsche Bank, now thinks [gold prices could approach \\$5,000 during 2026](https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/gold-price). Whilst [a recent Financial Times survey](https://www.ft.com/content/a2b62f00-3174-4818-9a90-7489fc9be6d8) suggests gold is set to \"extend its historic rally to hit fresh highs in 2026, although analysts expect the metal\u2019s advance to slow after a year of stunning gains\".\n\nAs [Reuters reported on January 5, 2026](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-surges-us-capture-venezuela-president-spurs-safe-haven-demand-2026-01-05/), current geopolitical risks may continue to affect the price of gold during 2026.\n\n> Gold rose to a one-week high and nearer its record peak on Monday as safe-haven demand spurred by U.S. strikes in Venezuela added to bullion's appeal, already fuelled by geopolitical tensions and rate cut bets."

His leadership has been closely associated with the expansion of state militarization and the consolidation of power within the office of the Supreme Leader. Khamenei has also faced many protests [during his time as Supreme Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei).&#x20;\n\nOn December 29, 2025, [Iran\u2019s largest protests in three years](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) erupted after [the country\u2019s currency plummeted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-gold-silver-jewelry-sales-israel-war-0e774bc3c2fea972ab3225e1864a438e) to a record low against the U.S. dollar, and the head of the Central Bank resigned.&#x20;\n\n[Later in the week](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d),\n\n> U.S. President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials exchanged dueling threats Friday as [widening protests](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) swept across parts of the Islamic Republic, further escalating tensions between the countries after [America bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-war-nuclear-talks-geneva-news-06-21-2025-a7b0cdaba28b5817467ccf712d214579).\n\nOn January 3, 2026, [Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader insisted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-nuclear-economy-cf491782ecafdc9098878e5a4e5dc384),\n\n> that \u201crioters must be put in their place\u201d after a week of protests that have shaken the Islamic Republic, likely giving security forces a green light to aggressively put down the demonstrations... the demonstrations sparked by Iran\u2019s ailing economy has killed at least 15 people, according to human rights activists.&#x20;\n\n> While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. They also take on new importance after Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President [Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-explosions-caracas-ca712a67aaefc30b1831f5bf0b50665e), a longtime ally of Tehran.",

        "description": "Since June 4, 1989 Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, has been [Supreme Leader of Iran](https://www.leader.ir/en), a position that has been [described by Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/country/iran) as having the ultimate power within the country.&#x20;\n\nIdentified as a pragmatic hardliner, Khamenei sidelined leftist factions, moderate clerics, and political dissidents, while occasionally easing restrictions when the government's stability or legitimacy has been threatened. His leadership has been closely associated with the expansion of state militarization and the consolidation of power within the office of the Supreme Leader. Khamenei has also faced many protests [during his time as Supreme Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei).&#x20;\n\nOn December 29, 2025, [Iran\u2019s largest protests in three years](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) erupted after [the country\u2019s currency plummeted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-gold-silver-jewelry-sales-israel-war-0e774bc3c2fea972ab3225e1864a438e) to a record low against the U.S. dollar, and the head of the Central Bank resigned.&#x20;\n\n[Later in the week](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d),\n\n> U.S. President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials exchanged dueling threats Friday as [widening protests](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) swept across parts of the Islamic Republic, further escalating tensions between the countries after [America bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-war-nuclear-talks-geneva-news-06-21-2025-a7b0cdaba28b5817467ccf712d214579).\n\nOn January 3, 2026, [Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader insisted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-nuclear-economy-cf491782ecafdc9098878e5a4e5dc384),\n\n> that \u201crioters must be put in their place\u201d after a week of protests that have shaken the Islamic Republic, likely giving security forces a green light to aggressively put down the demonstrations... the demonstrations sparked by Iran\u2019s ailing economy has killed at least 15 people, according to human rights activists.&#x20;\n\n> While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. They also take on new importance after Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President [Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-explosions-caracas-ca712a67aaefc30b1831f5bf0b50665e), a longtime ally of Tehran."

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting. He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega.

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting. He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega. In 1983, the UNGA passed Resolution [38/7](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/38/7) condemning the US [invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Grenada) of Grenada.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41499,\"question_id\":41228}}`"

        "description": "A podium sweep occurs when athletes from the same country win gold, silver, and bronze in a single Olympic event.\n\nPodium sweeps have become increasingly rare at the Winter Olympics but can occur in disciplines where a country has exceptional depth, such as cross-country skiing, speed skating, alpine skiing, or freestyle skiing.\n\nRecent Winter Olympics illustrate the pattern:\n\n* [2022 Beijing Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Winter_Olympics#Podium_sweeps): 1 podium sweep (Germany)\n* [2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Winter_Olympics#Podium_sweeps): 3 podium sweeps (Netherlands, Norway, Germany)\n* [2014 Sochi Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics#Podium_sweeps): 8 podium sweeps (Netherlands x4, USA, France, Norway, Russia)\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympic Games will be held in Milan\u2013Cortina, Italy, from February 6 to 22, 2026. As in past Games, countries such as Norway, Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, and others may field multiple medal contenders in the same events, creating the possibility of podium sweeps.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41370,\"question_id\":41081}}`"

In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.\"\n\n> Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.\n\n> \"We have to fix the country first. You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,\" Trump told NBC.\n\nSee also from Wikipedia: [Next Venezuelan Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Venezuelan_presidential_election)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41489,\"question_id\":41216}}`",

In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.\"\n\n> Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.\n\n> \"We have to fix the country first. You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,\" Trump told NBC.\n\nSee also from Wikipedia: [Next Venezuelan Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Venezuelan_presidential_election)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41489,\"question_id\":41216}}`"

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting.

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting. He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega. In 1983, the UNGA passed Resolution [38/7](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/38/7) condemning the US [invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Grenada) of Grenada.&#x20;"

Hammond bets that real US GDP growth will average above 5% from 2028 to 2033 on a compound annual growth basis, while Luttig bets against. Hammond [recently outlined](/) his expectations of faster growth due to AI in the next decade, a position he has [held since around the time the bet was made](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/08/manhattan-project-for-ai-safety-00095779).\n\nLuttig has written pieces from the [time of the bet](https://blog.johnluttig.com/p/hallucinations-in-ai) and [recently](https://blog.johnluttig.com/p/hypercapitalism-and-the-ai-talent) suggesting that AI is likely to continue advancing and could lead to significant changes, though has generally taken a more cautious and uncertain position around its effects and trajectory. No public statements by Luttig explicitly addressing the bet were identified."

This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\"",
          "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, after January 7, 2026, but before May 1, 2026, the United States carries out an attack against Venezuela's territory or military forces, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).",
          "fine_print": "* To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Venezuelan territory or military forces: cyberattacks or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.\n* For the purpose of this question, Venezuela's territory refers to its land and internal waters. External waters such as territorial waters will not count.\n* The peaceful presence of U.S. troops or personnel in Venezuela with the assent of Venezuela's government will not cause this question to resolve as **Yes**.\n* The U.S. need not initiate a conflict in order for the question to resolve as **Yes**.",

        "description": "On January 3, 2026, the United States launched a [surprise attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_States_strikes_in_Venezuela) on Venezuela, bombing military bases and infrastructure and capturing and removing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife from the country. This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\""

[<u>Presidential autopens have been used across multiple administrations to sign executive orders</u>](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/nx-s1-5330709/autopen-biden-pardon-void), proclamations, and other official acts, and longstanding legal guidance indicates that a president does not need to physically sign a document themselves for it to be valid so long as the signature reflects the president\u2019s authorization.\n\nIn late 2025, former President Donald Trump publicly declared via social media that all executive orders, pardons, and other actions signed using an autopen under Joe Biden\u2019s administration were [<u>\u201cnull and void\u201d and \u201cof no further force or effect.\u201d</u>](https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/34128?) The claim was echoed by Republican lawmakers and a [<u>House Oversight Committee report</u>](https://news.ssbcrack.com/house-oversight-committee-urges-doj-investigation-into-bidens-autopen-usage-questions-legitimacy-of-executive-actions/) asserting that Biden\u2019s alleged cognitive decline and use of the autopen could undermine the legitimacy of his actions.\n\nLegal experts and nonpartisan fact-checkers have countered these claims, noting there is [<u>no constitutional mechanism for one president to unilaterally declare another president\u2019s actions void simply because an autopen was used</u>](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-claim-that-biden-pardons-are-void-because-he-used-an-autopen). The Constitution and longstanding practice empower the president to [<u>issue pardons</u>](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46179) and [<u>take executive actions</u>](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-1/ALDE_00000243/); courts have generally held that mechanical signatures are valid if the underlying decision was the president\u2019s.\n\nAs of late 2025, [<u>Republican calls for investigations or legal reviews</u>](https://www.wbbjtv.com/2025/10/28/republicans-send-biden-autopen-report-to-the-justice-department-urging-further-investigation/) by the Department of Justice and other officials have not resulted in any judicial rulings declaring Biden\u2019s autopen-signed orders invalid. Whether any such legal challenge will reach a court with jurisdiction to consider the constitutional validity of these actions \u2014 and whether a court would rule they are \u201cnull and void\u201d \u2014 remains unresolved.",
          "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as Yes if, on or before November 4, 2026:\n\nA federal district or appellate court issues a final ruling that at least one specific executive action signed by Joe Biden using an autopen are legally invalid, such that they are formally declared null and void under law.",
          "fine_print": "If the ruling is subject to appeal, this question will wait until November 4, 2026 to resolve.&#x20;\n\nIf the ruling is stayed or reversed, this question will not resolved based upon it.",

[<u>Presidential autopens have been used across multiple administrations to sign executive orders</u>](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/nx-s1-5330709/autopen-biden-pardon-void), proclamations, and other official acts, and longstanding legal guidance indicates that a president does not need to physically sign a document themselves for it to be valid so long as the signature reflects the president\u2019s authorization.\n\nIn late 2025, former President Donald Trump publicly declared via social media that all executive orders, pardons, and other actions signed using an autopen under Joe Biden\u2019s administration were [<u>\u201cnull and void\u201d and \u201cof no further force or effect.\u201d</u>](https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/34128?) The claim was echoed by Republican lawmakers and a [<u>House Oversight Committee report</u>](https://news.ssbcrack.com/house-oversight-committee-urges-doj-investigation-into-bidens-autopen-usage-questions-legitimacy-of-executive-actions/) asserting that Biden\u2019s alleged cognitive decline and use of the autopen could undermine the legitimacy of his actions.\n\nLegal experts and nonpartisan fact-checkers have countered these claims, noting there is [<u>no constitutional mechanism for one president to unilaterally declare another president\u2019s actions void simply because an autopen was used</u>](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-claim-that-biden-pardons-are-void-because-he-used-an-autopen). The Constitution and longstanding practice empower the president to [<u>issue pardons</u>](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46179) and [<u>take executive actions</u>](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-1/ALDE_00000243/); courts have generally held that mechanical signatures are valid if the underlying decision was the president\u2019s.\n\nAs of late 2025, [<u>Republican calls for investigations or legal reviews</u>](https://www.wbbjtv.com/2025/10/28/republicans-send-biden-autopen-report-to-the-justice-department-urging-further-investigation/) by the Department of Justice and other officials have not resulted in any judicial rulings declaring Biden\u2019s autopen-signed orders invalid. Whether any such legal challenge will reach a court with jurisdiction to consider the constitutional validity of these actions \u2014 and whether a court would rule they are \u201cnull and void\u201d \u2014 remains unresolved."

          "description": "*This forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy:* [*Will the U.S. Supreme Court overturn provisions of the Voting Rights Act as part of Louisiana v. Callais?*](https://www.verity.news/controversy/Will-the-US-Supreme-Court-overturn-provisions-in-the-Voting-Rights-Act-Louisiana-v-Callais)\n\nThe [<u>Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA)</u>](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act) is a foundational U.S. civil rights law designed to prevent racial discrimination in voting. [<u>Section 2 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act) prohibits voting practices or districting plans that result in minority voters having less opportunity than others to elect representatives of their choice, regardless of the intent behind the law or map. Unlike the VRA\u2019s preclearance regime, Section 2 applies nationwide and has remained the primary enforcement mechanism against discriminatory election maps following later court rulings.&nbsp;\n\nThe Supreme Court has narrowed portions of the VRA over the past decade. In [*<u>Shelby County v. Holder</u>*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96) (2013), the Court invalidated the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to federal preclearance, [<u>effectively suspending Section 5 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act). More recently, in [*<u>Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-1257_g204.pdf) (2021), the Court adopted a more restrictive framework for evaluating Section 2 claims related to voting rules, emphasizing state interests and historical practice.&nbsp;\n\nHowever, the Court appeared to reaffirm Section 2\u2019s application to redistricting in [*<u>Allen v. Milligan</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf) (2023), holding that Alabama\u2019s congressional map likely violated the VRA by failing to include an additional majority-Black district. The decision [<u>rejected arguments that Section 2 requires a race-neutral approach and reaffirmed longstanding precedent allowing race to be considered when remedying vote dilution.</u>](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-act-persists-so-do-its-adversaries#:~:text=But%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20stepped,protections%20for%20voters%20of%20color.)\n\n[*<u>Louisiana v. Callais</u>*](https://www.naacpldf.org/case-issue/louisiana-v-callais/) stems from [<u>post-2020 census redistricting in Louisiana</u>](https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Louisiana_after_the_2020_census). After lower federal courts found that the state\u2019s original congressional map likely violated Section 2 by containing only one majority-Black district despite the state's sizable Black population, Louisiana enacted a revised map creating a second such district. A group of voters then challenged the new map, arguing that it relied impermissibly on race and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court [<u>agreed to hear the case</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/louisiana-v-callais/), placing the continued scope of Section 2 squarely before the Court.\n\n[<u>Legal analysts note that the case could clarify or significantly alter the balance between the VRA and constitutional limits on race-based districting</u>](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-takeaways). Depending on how broadly the Court rules, the decision could [<u>either reaffirm Section 2\u2019s role in redistricting or substantially limit its future application nationwide</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/court-appears-ready-to-curtail-major-provision-of-the-voting-rights-act/).",

        "description": "*This forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy:* [*Will the U.S. Supreme Court overturn provisions of the Voting Rights Act as part of Louisiana v. Callais?*](https://www.verity.news/controversy/Will-the-US-Supreme-Court-overturn-provisions-in-the-Voting-Rights-Act-Louisiana-v-Callais)\n\nThe [<u>Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA)</u>](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act) is a foundational U.S. civil rights law designed to prevent racial discrimination in voting. [<u>Section 2 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act) prohibits voting practices or districting plans that result in minority voters having less opportunity than others to elect representatives of their choice, regardless of the intent behind the law or map. Unlike the VRA\u2019s preclearance regime, Section 2 applies nationwide and has remained the primary enforcement mechanism against discriminatory election maps following later court rulings.&nbsp;\n\nThe Supreme Court has narrowed portions of the VRA over the past decade. In [*<u>Shelby County v. Holder</u>*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96) (2013), the Court invalidated the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to federal preclearance, [<u>effectively suspending Section 5 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act). More recently, in [*<u>Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-1257_g204.pdf) (2021), the Court adopted a more restrictive framework for evaluating Section 2 claims related to voting rules, emphasizing state interests and historical practice.&nbsp;\n\nHowever, the Court appeared to reaffirm Section 2\u2019s application to redistricting in [*<u>Allen v. Milligan</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf) (2023), holding that Alabama\u2019s congressional map likely violated the VRA by failing to include an additional majority-Black district. The decision [<u>rejected arguments that Section 2 requires a race-neutral approach and reaffirmed longstanding precedent allowing race to be considered when remedying vote dilution.</u>](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-act-persists-so-do-its-adversaries#:~:text=But%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20stepped,protections%20for%20voters%20of%20color.)\n\n[*<u>Louisiana v. Callais</u>*](https://www.naacpldf.org/case-issue/louisiana-v-callais/) stems from [<u>post-2020 census redistricting in Louisiana</u>](https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Louisiana_after_the_2020_census). After lower federal courts found that the state\u2019s original congressional map likely violated Section 2 by containing only one majority-Black district despite the state's sizable Black population, Louisiana enacted a revised map creating a second such district. A group of voters then challenged the new map, arguing that it relied impermissibly on race and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court [<u>agreed to hear the case</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/louisiana-v-callais/), placing the continued scope of Section 2 squarely before the Court.\n\n[<u>Legal analysts note that the case could clarify or significantly alter the balance between the VRA and constitutional limits on race-based districting</u>](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-takeaways). Depending on how broadly the Court rules, the decision could [<u>either reaffirm Section 2\u2019s role in redistricting or substantially limit its future application nationwide</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/court-appears-ready-to-curtail-major-provision-of-the-voting-rights-act/)."

[Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gold-price-silver-whats-behind-the-surge/) and during periods of market volatility or economic uncertainty.\n\n[On 26 December 2025](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/should-i-invest-gold-prices-123542208.html), gold (GC=F) hit an all time high of \\$4,549.71 per ounce.&#x20;\n\n> Gold ([GC=F](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F)) prices extended gains at the start of the year after ending 2025 with a 64% rise, the strongest annual performance since 1979, as investors bet on further monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve... The metal has doubled in value from the \\$2,000 level it held two years ago.

Whilst [a recent Financial Times survey](https://www.ft.com/content/a2b62f00-3174-4818-9a90-7489fc9be6d8) suggests gold is set to \"extend its historic rally to hit fresh highs in 2026, although analysts expect the metal\u2019s advance to slow after a year of stunning gains\".\n\nAs [Reuters reported on January 5, 2026](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-surges-us-capture-venezuela-president-spurs-safe-haven-demand-2026-01-05/), current geopolitical risks may continue to affect the price of gold during 2026.\n\n> Gold rose to a one-week high and nearer its record peak on Monday as safe-haven demand spurred by U.S. strikes in Venezuela added to bullion's appeal, already fuelled by geopolitical tensions and rate cut bets.",

        "description": "Gold is highly popular among precious metals as an investment. Investors generally buy gold as a way of diversifying risk, especially through the use of futures contracts and derivatives. [Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gold-price-silver-whats-behind-the-surge/) and during periods of market volatility or economic uncertainty.\n\n[On 26 December 2025](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/should-i-invest-gold-prices-123542208.html), gold (GC=F) hit an all time high of \\$4,549.71 per ounce.&#x20;\n\n> Gold ([GC=F](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F)) prices extended gains at the start of the year after ending 2025 with a 64% rise, the strongest annual performance since 1979, as investors bet on further monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve... The metal has doubled in value from the \\$2,000 level it held two years ago. Since 2000, gold has outperformed global equities, delivering a return of more than 1,200%.\n\nMichael Hsueh, research analyst at Deutsche Bank, now thinks [gold prices could approach \\$5,000 during 2026](https://moneyweek.com/investments/commodities/gold/gold-price). Whilst [a recent Financial Times survey](https://www.ft.com/content/a2b62f00-3174-4818-9a90-7489fc9be6d8) suggests gold is set to \"extend its historic rally to hit fresh highs in 2026, although analysts expect the metal\u2019s advance to slow after a year of stunning gains\".\n\nAs [Reuters reported on January 5, 2026](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-surges-us-capture-venezuela-president-spurs-safe-haven-demand-2026-01-05/), current geopolitical risks may continue to affect the price of gold during 2026.\n\n> Gold rose to a one-week high and nearer its record peak on Monday as safe-haven demand spurred by U.S. strikes in Venezuela added to bullion's appeal, already fuelled by geopolitical tensions and rate cut bets."

His leadership has been closely associated with the expansion of state militarization and the consolidation of power within the office of the Supreme Leader.

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting. He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega.

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting. He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega. In 1983, the UNGA passed Resolution [38/7](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/38/7) condemning the US [invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Grenada) of Grenada.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41499,\"question_id\":41228}}`"

        "description": "A podium sweep occurs when athletes from the same country win gold, silver, and bronze in a single Olympic event.\n\nPodium sweeps have become increasingly rare at the Winter Olympics but can occur in disciplines where a country has exceptional depth, such as cross-country skiing, speed skating, alpine skiing, or freestyle skiing.\n\nRecent Winter Olympics illustrate the pattern:\n\n* [2022 Beijing Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Winter_Olympics#Podium_sweeps): 1 podium sweep (Germany)\n* [2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Winter_Olympics#Podium_sweeps): 3 podium sweeps (Netherlands, Norway, Germany)\n* [2014 Sochi Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics#Podium_sweeps): 8 podium sweeps (Netherlands x4, USA, France, Norway, Russia)\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympic Games will be held in Milan\u2013Cortina, Italy, from February 6 to 22, 2026. As in past Games, countries such as Norway, Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, and others may field multiple medal contenders in the same events, creating the possibility of podium sweeps.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41370,\"question_id\":41081}}`"

In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.\"\n\n> Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.\n\n> \"We have to fix the country first. You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,\" Trump told NBC.\n\nSee also from Wikipedia: [Next Venezuelan Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Venezuelan_presidential_election)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41489,\"question_id\":41216}}`",

In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.\"\n\n> Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.\n\n> \"We have to fix the country first. You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,\" Trump told NBC.\n\nSee also from Wikipedia: [Next Venezuelan Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Venezuelan_presidential_election)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41489,\"question_id\":41216}}`"

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting. He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega.

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting. He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega. In 1983, the UNGA passed Resolution [38/7](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/38/7) condemning the US [invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Grenada) of Grenada.&#x20;"

The primary elections will take place on May 5, 2026. Incumbent Republican Governor Mike DeWine is term-limited and cannot seek a third consecutive term.\n\nOnce considered a key battleground state and bellwether, Ohio has shifted significantly to the right in the last decade. At the state level, Republicans hold [a government trifecta and a triplex](https://ballotpedia.org/State_government_trifectas_and_triplexes), and incumbent governor DeWine was re-elected in 2022 by a 25-point margin.

In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.\"\n\n> Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.\n\n> \"We have to fix the country first. You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,\" Trump told NBC.\n\nSee also from Wikipedia: [Next Venezuelan Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Venezuelan_presidential_election)"

This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\"",

          "fine_print": "* To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Venezuelan territory or military forces: cyberattacks or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.\n* For the purpose of this question, Venezuela's territory refers to its land and internal waters. External waters such as territorial waters will not count.\n* The peaceful presence of U.S. troops or personnel in Venezuela with the assent of Venezuela's government will not cause this question to resolve as **Yes**.\n* The U.S. need not initiate a conflict in order for the question to resolve as **Yes**.",

This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\""

[<u>Presidential autopens have been used across multiple administrations to sign executive orders</u>](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/nx-s1-5330709/autopen-biden-pardon-void), proclamations, and other official acts, and longstanding legal guidance indicates that a president does not need to physically sign a document themselves for it to be valid so long as the signature reflects the president\u2019s authorization.\n\nIn late 2025, former President Donald Trump publicly declared via social media that all executive orders, pardons, and other actions signed using an autopen under Joe Biden\u2019s administration were [<u>\u201cnull and void\u201d and \u201cof no further force or effect.\u201d</u>](https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/34128?) The claim was echoed by Republican lawmakers and a [<u>House Oversight Committee report</u>](https://news.ssbcrack.com/house-oversight-committee-urges-doj-investigation-into-bidens-autopen-usage-questions-legitimacy-of-executive-actions/) asserting that Biden\u2019s alleged cognitive decline and use of the autopen could undermine the legitimacy of his actions.\n\nLegal experts and nonpartisan fact-checkers have countered these claims, noting there is [<u>no constitutional mechanism for one president to unilaterally declare another president\u2019s actions void simply because an autopen was used</u>](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-claim-that-biden-pardons-are-void-because-he-used-an-autopen). The Constitution and longstanding practice empower the president to [<u>issue pardons</u>](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46179) and [<u>take executive actions</u>](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-1/ALDE_00000243/); courts have generally held that mechanical signatures are valid if the underlying decision was the president\u2019s.\n\nAs of late 2025, [<u>Republican calls for investigations or legal reviews</u>](https://www.wbbjtv.com/2025/10/28/republicans-send-biden-autopen-report-to-the-justice-department-urging-further-investigation/) by the Department of Justice and other officials have not resulted in any judicial rulings declaring Biden\u2019s autopen-signed orders invalid. Whether any such legal challenge will reach a court with jurisdiction to consider the constitutional validity of these actions \u2014 and whether a court would rule they are \u201cnull and void\u201d \u2014 remains unresolved.",
          "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as Yes if, on or before November 4, 2026:\n\nA federal district or appellate court issues a final ruling that at least one specific executive action signed by Joe Biden using an autopen are legally invalid, such that they are formally declared null and void under law.",
          "fine_print": "If the ruling is subject to appeal, this question will wait until November 4, 2026 to resolve.&#x20;\n\nIf the ruling is stayed or reversed, this question will not resolved based upon it.",

        "description": "*This forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy: Will Joe Biden's autopen orders be declared 'null and void' before the 2026 midterms?*\n\nAn [<u>autopen</u>](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/29/what-is-an-autopen-and-why-cant-trump-stop-talking-about-it) is a mechanical device historically used by U.S. presidents to replicate signatures on official documents when the president is unavailable to sign each individually. [<u>Presidential autopens have been used across multiple administrations to sign executive orders</u>](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/nx-s1-5330709/autopen-biden-pardon-void), proclamations, and other official acts, and longstanding legal guidance indicates that a president does not need to physically sign a document themselves for it to be valid so long as the signature reflects the president\u2019s authorization.\n\nIn late 2025, former President Donald Trump publicly declared via social media that all executive orders, pardons, and other actions signed using an autopen under Joe Biden\u2019s administration were [<u>\u201cnull and void\u201d and \u201cof no further force or effect.\u201d</u>](https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/34128?) The claim was echoed by Republican lawmakers and a [<u>House Oversight Committee report</u>](https://news.ssbcrack.com/house-oversight-committee-urges-doj-investigation-into-bidens-autopen-usage-questions-legitimacy-of-executive-actions/) asserting that Biden\u2019s alleged cognitive decline and use of the autopen could undermine the legitimacy of his actions.\n\nLegal experts and nonpartisan fact-checkers have countered these claims, noting there is [<u>no constitutional mechanism for one president to unilaterally declare another president\u2019s actions void simply because an autopen was used</u>](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-claim-that-biden-pardons-are-void-because-he-used-an-autopen). The Constitution and longstanding practice empower the president to [<u>issue pardons</u>](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46179) and [<u>take executive actions</u>](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-1/ALDE_00000243/); courts have generally held that mechanical signatures are valid if the underlying decision was the president\u2019s.\n\nAs of late 2025, [<u>Republican calls for investigations or legal reviews</u>](https://www.wbbjtv.com/2025/10/28/republicans-send-biden-autopen-report-to-the-justice-department-urging-further-investigation/) by the Department of Justice and other officials have not resulted in any judicial rulings declaring Biden\u2019s autopen-signed orders invalid. Whether any such legal challenge will reach a court with jurisdiction to consider the constitutional validity of these actions \u2014 and whether a court would rule they are \u201cnull and void\u201d \u2014 remains unresolved."

The designation led to a slashing of US assistance to the country. [The Trump administration also imposed sanctions](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-petro-sanctions-drug-trafficking-1b6ead338ec266b3df40859db6ee2d8d) in October 2025 on President Gustavo Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade.\n\nOn January 5, 2026, US President [Donald J. Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-new-military-operation-focused-colombia-sounds-good-him-2026-01-05/) told reporters aboard Air Force One that military action against Colombia's government \"sounds good to me\":\n\n> \"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump told reporters... in an apparent reference to Colombia's President.\n\nColombia\u2019s outspoken left-wing President has responded to the US capture of [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-capture-trump-attack-military-ceb21da088f0a06b1813e66922def9a3) by escalating his [spiraling war of words with the US President](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-petro-trump-venezuela-maduro-eaf98a41ae427a2d218910606a6fa3e0), stating it was an \u201cabhorrent\u201d violation of [Latin American sovereignty](https://apnews.com/photo-gallery/trump-venezuela-cuba-colombia-mexico-imperialism-600f77e9930aaf6cd856b4a384c51287). He also suggested it was committed by \"enslavers\" and constituted a \"spectacle of death\" comparable to Nazi Germany\u2019s 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.\n\nDespite this, just days later the [US President abruptly changed](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-venezuela-petro-610cfdb86d38544712c3f673639845e1) his tone stating the two Presidents had exchanged a friendly phone call and he had invited the Colombian President to the White House.\n\n[The two countries have a historic alliance](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-petro-trump-venezuela-maduro-eaf98a41ae427a2d218910606a6fa3e0) but political tensions remain.\n\n> For Colombia, the U.S. remains key to the military\u2019s fight against leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers. Washington has provided Bogot\u00e1 with roughly \\$14 billion in the last two decades.\n\n> For the U.S., Colombia remains the cornerstone of its counternarcotics strategy abroad, providing crucial intelligence used [to interdict drugs in the Caribbean](https://apnews.com/article/only-on-ap-smuggling-30c3e97599eb4b859ca575c58baab4ef).",

        "description": "In September 2025, the United States added Colombia to a list of nations [failing to cooperate in the drug war](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-drug-war-cooperation-14493c8f7a9af102a8a29cc368ac1e03) for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of US assistance to the country. [The Trump administration also imposed sanctions](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-petro-sanctions-drug-trafficking-1b6ead338ec266b3df40859db6ee2d8d) in October 2025 on President Gustavo Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade.\n\nOn January 5, 2026, US President [Donald J. Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-new-military-operation-focused-colombia-sounds-good-him-2026-01-05/) told reporters aboard Air Force One that military action against Colombia's government \"sounds good to me\":\n\n> \"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump told reporters... in an apparent reference to Colombia's President.\n\nColombia\u2019s outspoken left-wing President has responded to the US capture of [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-capture-trump-attack-military-ceb21da088f0a06b1813e66922def9a3) by escalating his [spiraling war of words with the US President](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-petro-trump-venezuela-maduro-eaf98a41ae427a2d218910606a6fa3e0), stating it was an \u201cabhorrent\u201d violation of [Latin American sovereignty](https://apnews.com/photo-gallery/trump-venezuela-cuba-colombia-mexico-imperialism-600f77e9930aaf6cd856b4a384c51287). He also suggested it was committed by \"enslavers\" and constituted a \"spectacle of death\" comparable to Nazi Germany\u2019s 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.\n\nDespite this, just days later the [US President abruptly changed](https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-venezuela-petro-610cfdb86d38544712c3f673639845e1) his tone stating the two Presidents had exchanged a friendly phone call and he had invited the Colombian President to the White House.\n\n[The two countries have a historic alliance](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-petro-trump-venezuela-maduro-eaf98a41ae427a2d218910606a6fa3e0) but political tensions remain.\n\n> For Colombia, the U.S. remains key to the military\u2019s fight against leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers. Washington has provided Bogot\u00e1 with roughly \\$14 billion in the last two decades.\n\n> For the U.S., Colombia remains the cornerstone of its counternarcotics strategy abroad, providing crucial intelligence used [to interdict drugs in the Caribbean](https://apnews.com/article/only-on-ap-smuggling-30c3e97599eb4b859ca575c58baab4ef)."

This was a law enforcement operation,\u201d the ambassador, Mike Waltz, said during the council\u2019s emergency meeting. He argued that the capture of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on drug charges made Latin America safer.\n\nIn 1989 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution [44/240](https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/44/240) condemning the American [capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) of Panama's ruler, Manuel Noriega.

As in past Games, countries such as Norway, Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, and others may field multiple medal contenders in the same events, creating the possibility of podium sweeps.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41370,\"question_id\":41081}}`",

In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.\"\n\n> Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.\n\n> \"We have to fix the country first. You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,\" Trump told NBC.\n\nSee also from Wikipedia: [Next Venezuelan Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Venezuelan_presidential_election)"

This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\"",

          "fine_print": "* To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Venezuelan territory or military forces: cyberattacks or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.\n* For the purpose of this question, Venezuela's territory refers to its land and internal waters. External waters such as territorial waters will not count.\n* The peaceful presence of U.S. troops or personnel in Venezuela with the assent of Venezuela's government will not cause this question to resolve as **Yes**.\n* The U.S. need not initiate a conflict in order for the question to resolve as **Yes**.",

        "description": "On January 3, 2026, the United States launched a [surprise attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_States_strikes_in_Venezuela) on Venezuela, bombing military bases and infrastructure and capturing and removing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife from the country. This attack was the apparent culmination of a [months-long buildup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_buildup_in_the_Caribbean_during_Operation_Southern_Spear) of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean Sea which included multiple airstrikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly piloted by drug traffickers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there has been some confusion about the U.S. government's future intentions with respect to Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that [the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry) but also indicated that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would assume the presidency. (Rodr\u00edguez, for her part, denounced the attack and declared that Maduro remained the lawful President.) U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html) that the U.S. would be involved in governing or occupying Venezuela, indicating that the U.S. simply intended to continue to put financial pressure on Venezuela's oil industry. Trump has also asserted that Rodr\u00edguez would cooperate with the U.S. government, stating \"we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.\""

[<u>Presidential autopens have been used across multiple administrations to sign executive orders</u>](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/nx-s1-5330709/autopen-biden-pardon-void), proclamations, and other official acts, and longstanding legal guidance indicates that a president does not need to physically sign a document themselves for it to be valid so long as the signature reflects the president\u2019s authorization.\n\nIn late 2025, former President Donald Trump publicly declared via social media that all executive orders, pardons, and other actions signed using an autopen under Joe Biden\u2019s administration were [<u>\u201cnull and void\u201d and \u201cof no further force or effect.\u201d</u>](https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/34128?) The claim was echoed by Republican lawmakers and a [<u>House Oversight Committee report</u>](https://news.ssbcrack.com/house-oversight-committee-urges-doj-investigation-into-bidens-autopen-usage-questions-legitimacy-of-executive-actions/) asserting that Biden\u2019s alleged cognitive decline and use of the autopen could undermine the legitimacy of his actions.\n\nLegal experts and nonpartisan fact-checkers have countered these claims, noting there is [<u>no constitutional mechanism for one president to unilaterally declare another president\u2019s actions void simply because an autopen was used</u>](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-claim-that-biden-pardons-are-void-because-he-used-an-autopen). The Constitution and longstanding practice empower the president to [<u>issue pardons</u>](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46179) and [<u>take executive actions</u>](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-1/ALDE_00000243/); courts have generally held that mechanical signatures are valid if the underlying decision was the president\u2019s.\n\nAs of late 2025, [<u>Republican calls for investigations or legal reviews</u>](https://www.wbbjtv.com/2025/10/28/republicans-send-biden-autopen-report-to-the-justice-department-urging-further-investigation/) by the Department of Justice and other officials have not resulted in any judicial rulings declaring Biden\u2019s autopen-signed orders invalid. Whether any such legal challenge will reach a court with jurisdiction to consider the constitutional validity of these actions \u2014 and whether a court would rule they are \u201cnull and void\u201d \u2014 remains unresolved.",

          "description": "Since June 4, 1989 Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, has been [Supreme Leader of Iran](https://www.leader.ir/en), a position that has been [described by Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/country/iran) as having the ultimate power within the country.&#x20;\n\nIdentified as a pragmatic hardliner, Khamenei sidelined leftist factions, moderate clerics, and political dissidents, while occasionally easing restrictions when the government's stability or legitimacy has been threatened. His leadership has been closely associated with the expansion of state militarization and the consolidation of power within the office of the Supreme Leader. Khamenei has also faced many protests [during his time as Supreme Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei).&#x20;\n\nOn December 29, 2025, [Iran\u2019s largest protests in three years](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) erupted after [the country\u2019s currency plummeted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-gold-silver-jewelry-sales-israel-war-0e774bc3c2fea972ab3225e1864a438e) to a record low against the U.S. dollar, and the head of the Central Bank resigned.&#x20;\n\n[Later in the week](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d),\n\n> U.S. President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials exchanged dueling threats Friday as [widening protests](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) swept across parts of the Islamic Republic, further escalating tensions between the countries after [America bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-war-nuclear-talks-geneva-news-06-21-2025-a7b0cdaba28b5817467ccf712d214579).\n\nOn January 3, 2026, [Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader insisted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-nuclear-economy-cf491782ecafdc9098878e5a4e5dc384),\n\n> that \u201crioters must be put in their place\u201d after a week of protests that have shaken the Islamic Republic, likely giving security forces a green light to aggressively put down the demonstrations... the demonstrations sparked by Iran\u2019s ailing economy has killed at least 15 people, according to human rights activists.&#x20;\n\n> While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. They also take on new importance after Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President [Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-explosions-caracas-ca712a67aaefc30b1831f5bf0b50665e), a longtime ally of Tehran.",

        "description": "Since June 4, 1989 Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, has been [Supreme Leader of Iran](https://www.leader.ir/en), a position that has been [described by Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/country/iran) as having the ultimate power within the country.&#x20;\n\nIdentified as a pragmatic hardliner, Khamenei sidelined leftist factions, moderate clerics, and political dissidents, while occasionally easing restrictions when the government's stability or legitimacy has been threatened. His leadership has been closely associated with the expansion of state militarization and the consolidation of power within the office of the Supreme Leader. Khamenei has also faced many protests [during his time as Supreme Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei).&#x20;\n\nOn December 29, 2025, [Iran\u2019s largest protests in three years](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) erupted after [the country\u2019s currency plummeted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-gold-silver-jewelry-sales-israel-war-0e774bc3c2fea972ab3225e1864a438e) to a record low against the U.S. dollar, and the head of the Central Bank resigned.&#x20;\n\n[Later in the week](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d),\n\n> U.S. President Donald Trump and top Iranian officials exchanged dueling threats Friday as [widening protests](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) swept across parts of the Islamic Republic, further escalating tensions between the countries after [America bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-war-nuclear-talks-geneva-news-06-21-2025-a7b0cdaba28b5817467ccf712d214579).\n\nOn January 3, 2026, [Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader insisted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-nuclear-economy-cf491782ecafdc9098878e5a4e5dc384),\n\n> that \u201crioters must be put in their place\u201d after a week of protests that have shaken the Islamic Republic, likely giving security forces a green light to aggressively put down the demonstrations... the demonstrations sparked by Iran\u2019s ailing economy has killed at least 15 people, according to human rights activists.&#x20;\n\n> While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. They also take on new importance after Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President [Nicol\u00e1s Maduro](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-explosions-caracas-ca712a67aaefc30b1831f5bf0b50665e), a longtime ally of Tehran."
