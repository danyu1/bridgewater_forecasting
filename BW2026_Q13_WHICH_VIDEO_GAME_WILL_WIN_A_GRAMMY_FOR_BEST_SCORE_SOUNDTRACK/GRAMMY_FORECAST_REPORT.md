## STRUCTURAL MODEL: FACTOR ANALYSIS

### Factor Weights Applied

| Factor | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Prior Grammy Winner | +20% | Haab won 2024 - strong precedent |
| John Williams Style | +15% | Recording Academy loves this aesthetic |
| Orchestral Score | +15% | 100% of past winners were orchestral |
| Abbey Road Recording | +10% | Prestige recording adds credibility |
| Vote Splitting | -15% | Roget II nominated twice, votes divided |
| Expansion/DLC | -10% | Less prestige than full game scores |
| Industry Buzz | +10% | Critical reception and press coverage |

### Factor Scores by Nominee

#### Indiana Jones And The Great Circle (Gordy Haab) — HIGHEST SCORE
| Factor | Score | Contribution |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Prior Grammy Winner | 1.0 | +20.0% |
| Williams Style | 1.0 | +15.0% |
| Orchestral Score | 1.0 | +15.0% |
| Abbey Road Recording | 1.0 | +10.0% |
| Industry Buzz | 0.9 | +9.0% |
| Vote Splitting | 0.0 | 0% |
| **Total Adjustment** | | **+69.0%** |

**Key Evidence:**
- Gordy Haab already won a Grammy in 2024 for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
- Billboard described him as the "heir apparent" to John Williams
- Recorded at Abbey Road Studios with full orchestra
- The Ringer feature highlighted his "uncanny ability to channel Williams"
- No vote splitting issues

#### Sword of the Sea (Austin Wintory) — SECOND HIGHEST
| Factor | Score | Contribution |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Prior Nominations | 4 | +20.0% |
| Abbey Road Recording | 1.0 | +10.0% |
| Orchestral Score | 0.7 | +10.5% |
| Industry Buzz | 0.7 | +7.0% |
| Original IP | 1.0 | +5.0% |
| **Total Adjustment** | | **+52.5%** |

**Key Evidence:**
- Austin Wintory made history as first VG composer Grammy-nominated (Journey, 2013)
- 4x Grammy nominated in this category (Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Stray Gods, now Sword of Sea)
- Highly respected in industry; acknowledged Clair Obscur snub publicly
- Has never won despite multiple nominations (concern)

#### Helldivers 2 (Wilbert Roget II) — VOTE SPLITTING VICTIM
| Factor | Score | Contribution |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Industry Buzz | 0.8 | +8.0% |
| Orchestral Score | 0.8 | +12.0% |
| Original IP | 1.0 | +5.0% |
| Vote Splitting | 1.0 | **-15.0%** |
| **Total Adjustment** | | **+10.0%** |

**Critical Issue:** Wilbert Roget II is nominated for BOTH Helldivers 2 AND Star Wars Outlaws. Combined, these represent 40.3% of community probability. Vote splitting will likely hurt both nominations.

#### Star Wars Outlaws (Johnson & Roget II) — DOUBLE DISADVANTAGE
| Factor | Score | Contribution |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Orchestral Score | 1.0 | +15.0% |
| Williams Style | 0.5 | +7.5% |
| Franchise | 1.0 | +5.0% |
| Expansion DLC | 1.0 | **-10.0%** |
| Vote Splitting | 1.0 | **-15.0%** |
| **Total Adjustment** | | **+7.5%** |

#### Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora (Pinar Toprak) — WEAKEST POSITION
| Factor | Score | Contribution |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Orchestral Score | 1.0 | +15.0% |
| Franchise | 1.0 | +5.0% |
| Expansion DLC | 1.0 | **-10.0%** |
| Industry Buzz | 0.3 | +3.0% |
| **Total Adjustment** | | **+13.0%** |

**Concerns:**
- Pinar Toprak has no prior Grammy nominations
- Least industry buzz of all nominees
- Just expansion DLC content

---

## VOTE SPLITTING ANALYSIS

This is the most critical structural factor in this race.

**Wilbert Roget II is nominated for TWO soundtracks:**
1. Helldivers 2 (23.3% community)
2. Star Wars Outlaws (17.0% community, co-composer)

**Combined: 40.3%** — If there were no splitting, this would make Roget the frontrunner.

However, Recording Academy members who prefer Roget's work will split their votes between these two entries, likely benefiting:
- **Indiana Jones** (no splitting, clear single entry)
- **Sword of the Sea** (no splitting, Wintory's sole nomination)

## EXTERNAL SIGNALS

### Community Consensus (Metaculus, 413 forecasters)
| Nominee | Community % |
|---------|-------------|
| Helldivers 2 | 23.3% |
| Indiana Jones | 23.3% |
| Sword of the Sea | 21.2% |
| Star Wars Outlaws | 17.0% |
| Avatar | 15.2% |

### Expert Commentary (from Metaculus discussion)

**ts1 (yesterday):**
> "Helldivers will suffer from vote splitting, and Indiana Jones is a really good pick. The Recording Academy love orchestral composition, and reviews talked about Haab's score for perfectly emulating John Williams."

**seekingalpha (2 hours ago):**
> "Star Wars surprisingly sounded the best... Star Wars has won in the past demonstrating the franchise has an appeal in the academy."

| Community Forecast | 50% |

### Final Adjusted Forecast

After rounding and applying judgment based on:

## VALIDATION

### Pre-Mortem: Why I Could Be Wrong

1. **Wintory finally wins (Medium likelihood)**
   - 4x nominated, highly respected, Academy may want to reward his career
   - Would change estimate to: Sword of Sea 35%, Indiana Jones 28%

2. **Helldivers 2 popularity overcomes splitting (Low-Medium likelihood)**
   - Game was massive cultural phenomenon
   - Members might coordinate on more popular title
   - Would change estimate to: Helldivers 30%, Indiana Jones 25%

3. **Star Wars franchise power (Low likelihood)**
   - Star Wars won in 2024 (Jedi: Survivor)
   - Franchise has proven Grammy appeal
   - Would change estimate to: SW Outlaws 25%, Indiana Jones 28%

### Sanity Checks

- ☑ All probabilities between 5-95%
- ☑ Probabilities sum to 100%
- ☑ Divergence from community explained (vote splitting, prior winner advantage)
- ☑ Checked prediction markets (none found for this specific question)
- ☑ Recent news checked (Grammy nominations announced Nov 2025)

---

## KEY REASONING (Executive Summary)

**Indiana Jones And The Great Circle is my top pick (33%)** because:

1. **Gordy Haab already won this Grammy** in 2024 for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor — the Recording Academy has proven they like his work

2. **John Williams emulation is exactly what the Academy loves** — Billboard called Haab the "heir apparent" to Williams, and The Ringer featured how his score "perfectly emulates" the maestro

3. **Full orchestral recording at Abbey Road** — the prestige and production value the Academy rewards

4. **No vote splitting** — unlike Roget II who has votes divided across two nominations

5. **100% of past winners have been orchestral** — Indiana Jones fits this pattern perfectly

**What would change my mind:**
- If evidence emerged that Academy members are coordinating votes around Helldivers 2
- If Wintory wins lifetime achievement momentum
- Any news suggesting vote splitting won't affect this race

## UPDATE TRIGGERS

| Event | New Forecast |
|-------|--------------|
| Prediction markets open with Indiana Jones < 25% | Reduce to 28% |
| Industry buzz shifts strongly to Wintory | Sword of Sea → 30%, Indiana Jones → 28% |
| Evidence of vote coordination for Helldivers | Helldivers → 28%, Indiana Jones → 28% |
