- `china_share_points.csv` is generated by `base_rate_calc.py`.

## External signals (from prompt)
- Leo.li123: import-based estimate around ~30% (Oct–Nov 2025 lithography imports; assumption about Oct+Nov fraction of Q4).
- Hasham: central tendency mid-30s with wide uncertainty.

## Key drivers to monitor
- Export controls / licensing changes impacting DUV shipments to China.
- Pull-forward dynamics (Chinese customers accelerating purchases ahead of potential restrictions).
- Mix shift toward EUV and high-end tools shipped primarily outside China, mechanically reducing China share even if China shipments are flat.
