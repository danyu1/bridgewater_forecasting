## 🧪 RESEARCH PAPERS

### Core GJP Research

| Paper | Authors | Finding |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Identifying and Cultivating Superforecasters** | Mellers et al. 2015 | Superforecaster traits and accuracy |
| **Developing expert political judgment** | Chang et al. 2016 | Training effects, comparison classes work best |
| **The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis** | Heuer | Classic CIA text on analytical methods |

### Key Findings Summary

1. **Comparison classes (base rates)** were the ONLY training principle significantly correlated with better forecasts
2. **Past performance** in forecasting is highly predictive of future performance (r=0.65)
3. **One hour of training** produced lasting accuracy improvements
4. **More updates per question** correlates with better accuracy
5. **Longer deliberation time** correlates with better accuracy
6. **Teams outperform individuals** (but superforecasters can match team performance)

## 🧠 KEY CONCEPTS FROM METACULUS RESOURCES

### The Five Principles to Counter Overconfidence

From Metaculus prediction resources:

1. **Consider alternatives** - especially in novel situations
2. **List reasons why the forecast might be wrong**
3. **Appoint a devil's advocate** (or use comment section)
4. **Obtain feedback about predictions**
5. **Treat feedback as valuable information**

### Fermi Estimation

Break intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:

1. Identify what you need to estimate
2. Break into smaller, estimable components
3. Estimate each component
4. Combine with proper probability math
5. Sanity check the result

### Base Rate Neglect

The most common forecasting error. To move away from base rates, you need:
1. Evidence that the usual process will FAIL
2. Evidence that the replacement will produce a DIFFERENT outcome

### The Outside vs Inside View

| View | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Outside View** | What typically happens in similar situations? (Base rate) | ALWAYS START HERE |
| **Inside View** | What's special about THIS specific situation? | Adjust from base rate |

**Tetlock's Rule:** Anchor on the outside view FIRST, then adjust using the inside view.

## 📊 TETLOCK'S TEN COMMANDMENTS

1. **Triage** - Focus on questions where you can add value
2. **Fermi-ize** - Break problems into tractable sub-problems  
3. **Balance views** - Anchor on outside view, adjust with inside view
4. **Balance reactivity** - Small updates usually, big updates when warranted
5. **Dragonfly eye** - Seek multiple perspectives, synthesize
6. **Granularity** - Use precise probabilities when possible
7. **Balance confidence** - Avoid both over and under confidence
8. **Learn from errors** - Without hindsight bias
9. **Collaborate** - Teams can outperform individuals
10. **Practice** - Forecasting is a skill that improves
11. **Meta-rule** - Don't follow rules blindly

## 🏆 TOURNAMENT-SPECIFIC TIPS

### Bridgewater Open Scoring

1. **Time-weighted**: Early forecasts earn more points
2. **Peer Score**: You're scored relative to other forecasters
3. **Proper scoring**: Honesty is rewarded, gaming is penalized

### Implications

- **Forecast early** - Don't wait for perfect information
- **Update frequently** - When evidence changes
- **Hard questions are valuable** - Beating the crowd matters more than absolute accuracy
- **Calibration matters** - Overconfidence hurts your score
