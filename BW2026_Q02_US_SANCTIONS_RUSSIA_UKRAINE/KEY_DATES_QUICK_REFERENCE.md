## Daily Monitoring Checklist

### MUST CHECK (takes 5 minutes):
1. **OFAC Recent Actions**: https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions
   - Look for Russia entries with "Ukraine" in press release
   
2. **Congress.gov S.1241**: https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1241/all-actions
   - Any new actions = major update

3. **Treasury Press Releases**: https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases
   - Search "Russia"

### Weekly Check:
- Polymarket ceasefire odds (currently 15% by Mar 31)
- Metaculus community median movement
- Graham/Blumenthal public statements

---

## Instant Resolution Triggers

**Question resolves YES immediately if:**
- OFAC designates any Russian entity AND press release says "Ukraine war/invasion/peace process"
- S.1241 passes and triggers mandatory presidential determination
- Any State Dept/Commerce/White House sanctions with explicit Ukraine language

**Example language that counts (from Oct 2025):**
> "as a result of Russia's lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine"

|-------|--------------|--------|
| S.1241 passes Senate | 94% | Update immediately |
| S.1241 signed into law | 98% | Update immediately |
| Any Ukraine-explicit sanctions | 100% | RESOLVE YES |
| Trump opposes sanctions | 55% | Major revision needed |

## Recommended Google Alerts

Set these up for email notifications:

```
"OFAC" AND "Russia" AND "sanctions"
"Sanctioning Russia Act"
"S.1241" OR "HR 2548"
"Treasury" AND "Russia" AND "Ukraine"
site:treasury.gov Russia
site:state.gov Russia sanctions
```

## Why These Dates Matter

1. **Jan 13-22**: Graham announced vote "as early as next week" on Jan 7. This is that window.

2. **Feb 22-24**: The 4-year anniversary of Russia's invasion. Historically, the US coordinates major sanctions announcements on symbolic dates with allies. The Oct 22, 2025 Rosneft/Lukoil sanctions show willingness to impose major penalties explicitly citing Ukraine.

3. **First of each month**: OFAC typically batches list updates. Check Feb 1 and Mar 1.

## What Would Make Me Wrong

1. **Rapid peace deal** - Currently only 15% probability by Mar 31
2. **Trump reversal** - He "greenlit" the bill, but could change mind
3. **All actions miss the language** - Every sanction is "routine" without Ukraine wording
4. **Legislative gridlock** - Despite 84 co-sponsors, procedural delays

Current assessment: All these scenarios are unlikely, hence 86% forecast.
