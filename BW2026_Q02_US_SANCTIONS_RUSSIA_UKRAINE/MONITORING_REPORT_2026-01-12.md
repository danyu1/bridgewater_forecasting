# MONITORING REPORT - January 12, 2026

## Current Forecast: 86% (NO CHANGE)

---

## SEARCH RESULTS SUMMARY

### 1. OFAC Recent Actions Check

**Status: ⚠️ Routine Updates Only - NO RESOLUTION TRIGGER**

Found recent OFAC activity:
- **January 08, 2026**: Russia-related Designation Update and Designation Removal
- **January 06, 2026**: Issuance of Amended Russia-related General License (GL 13P)

**Analysis**: These are routine technical/administrative updates (license amendments, minor list changes). They do NOT contain explicit Ukraine war language in their titles or descriptions. Per the resolution criteria, these would NOT count.

**Action**: Continue monitoring. These routine updates show OFAC is active, but we need an announcement explicitly citing Ukraine.

### 2. S.1241 (Sanctioning Russia Act) Status

**Status: ⏳ PENDING - Still in Committee**

Key findings:
- Bill remains in "first stage of legislative process" per GovTrack
- Last official action: April 1, 2025 (referred to Banking Committee)
- Trump "greenlit" the bill on January 7-9, 2026
- Graham stated vote could come "as early as next week"
- BUT: Senate schedule includes government funding vote and MLK recess

**Analysis**: Despite the greenlight, no floor vote has been scheduled yet. The bill has 84 co-sponsors (veto-proof), but procedural hurdles remain.

**Action**: Watch for:
- Cloture motion filing
- Senate floor schedule announcements
- Graham/Thune statements on timing

### 3. News Search Results

**Relevant Headlines Found:**

| Source | Headline | Ukraine Explicit? | Resolution? |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| The Hill | "Trump 'greenlit' tough Russia sanctions bill" | ✅ Yes (in title) | ❌ Bill not passed yet |
| ABC News | "sanctions bill aiming to punish Russia for war in Ukraine" | ✅ Yes | ❌ Bill not passed yet |
| Washington Times | "Senate to vote on Russia sanctions bill" | ✅ Yes | ❌ No vote yet |

**Analysis**: All news is about the PENDING bill, not a completed action. The question requires "binding legal action" - the bill's passage would qualify, but it hasn't happened yet.

## FORECAST UPDATE DECISION

### Should forecast change?

**NO** - Maintain 86%

**Reasoning:**
1. No new Ukraine-explicit sanctions have been announced since October 2025
2. S.1241 has not advanced procedurally despite the greenlight
3. The fundamentals haven't changed - we're still waiting for either:
   - Congressional passage of S.1241, OR
   - Executive branch sanctions with explicit Ukraine language

### What's different since initial forecast?
- Nothing material has changed
- Greenlight news was already incorporated in initial 86% estimate
- OFAC routine updates were expected and don't affect probability
